In the context of frontend development, props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. They are a fundamental part of React and other component-based JavaScript frameworks, enabling components to be customized and reused with different data inputs. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
What are Props?
Data Transfer:
Props are a way to send data from a parent component (the component that uses another component) to a child component (the component being used).
Unidirectional Data Flow:
Data flows in a single direction, from parent to child, meaning the child component cannot directly modify the props it receives.
Customization:
Props allow you to tailor the behavior and appearance of a child component based on the data provided by the parent.
Immutability:
Once a prop is passed to a component, it should be treated as immutable (read-only) within that component. 
How Props are Used:
1. Passing Props:
In the parent component, you pass data as attributes to the child component's JSX tag. For example: <ChildComponent message="Hello from Parent" />.
2. Receiving Props:
In the child component, you access the passed data through the props object. For example: function ChildComponent(props) { return <p>{props.message}</p>; }.
3. Using Props:
The received props can then be used within the child component's logic and rendering, just like any other JavaScript variable or property. 
Example:
Code

// Parent Component
function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Alice" />
      <Greeting name="Bob" />
    </div>
  );
}

// Child Component
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
In this example, the ParentComponent passes the name prop to the Greeting component, which then displays a personalized greeting. 
Benefits of Using Props:
Reusability:
Components can be reused with different data, making your code more efficient and maintainable. 
Flexibility:
Props allow you to customize the behavior and appearance of components based on various inputs. 
Maintainability:
Separating data from component logic makes it easier to understand, modify, and debug components.
